## Solution
I came up with the first idea of brute force the code was pretty simple but leet code wanted a faster time 

* **time complexity:** O(n^2)
* **Space complexity:** O(1)

As you can see it was very slow so I had to use a hashmap to increase time. At the end

* **time complexity:** O(n)
* **Space complexity:** O(n)

## Problem 
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
 

## Success 

* **Runtime:** 123 ms, faster than .<dir style="color: #FFFF00"> 75.56%</dir> of C++ online submissions for Contains  Duplicate

* **Memory Usage:** 52.2 MB, less than .<dir style="background-color: #FFFF00"> 29.16% </dir>of C++ online submissions for Contains Duplicate.
